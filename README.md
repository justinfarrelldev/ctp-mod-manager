# Call to Power Mod Manager

**VERY IMPORTANT NOTE**
This is ALPHA software, and it *will* have bugs! Back up any installations before using this mod manager on them.

This is a mod manager intended for use with the Call to Power series of games (however, it can be used for other games as well if desired).

# Features

## Finds Your Game Install

It will automatically find your installed Call to Power game and add it as a profile (so you can add mods to it if you wish).

## Non-Destructive 

All of the changes it makes aim to be non-destructive and entirely reversible. 

## Mod Diff View

The mod manager provides a diff view so you can see which files and lines each mod affects. This should allow you to safely add multiple mods together with confidence!

# F.A.Q.

*Why Electron?*

I am much more familiar with TypeScript, React and (now) Electron than I am with Rust, C++ or C. I definitely *can* code in C++ competently, but I am not nearly as confident and I have been trying to get this out as soon as I can.

*Why Call to Power?*

I am a huge fan of Call to Power II and I love the community. I run the Discord for the games and I can see that the community needs more tools to make modding not only easier but more accessible as well.
